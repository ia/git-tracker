USAGE:
------
git-tracker - simple set of python scripts,
which uses git commands for updating your local copies of cloned git repos.


SETTINGS:
git-tracker uses ~/.gitconfig for settings.
After it runs, it checks ~/.gitconfig, and, if there is no "track" section,
then creates it with default values for options.
Here example of "track" section in .gitconfig (see also WARNING 1):
...
[track]
	update = 60
	notify = 10
	pull = false
	uri = /home/ia/devel/src/git
	uri = /home/ia/devel/src/other-cloned-local-git-repo
	uri = ...
...
legend:
* update - time interval (in _minutes_) for checking updates;
* notify - time (_in seconds_) for showing notifications;
if 0, then app doesn't show notifies
* pull - pulling updates, if available. So, if its "false", then app just
shows notification with the latest commit message from updatable repo;
if it's "true", then app pulling updates(see also WARNING 2)
* uri - full path to local cloned git repo; _without_ "/" in the end.


WARNINGS:
* 1. at present time there is no any fool-tolerance checks for "track" settings in gitconfig.
* 2. checking of updates and pulling works _only_ with master branch;
so, if in some repo, which declared in "uri" option, current branch name _is not_ "master",
then probably will be errors during running app.
